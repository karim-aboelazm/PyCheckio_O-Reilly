<h2>Lightbulb More</h2>
<!-- Describe task in general -->
<p>
 The complication in the 6th mission of the series is that now there might be needed more than one light bulb to illuminate a room. And this is the 5th argument of the function - how many light bulbs are needed to illuminate the room.
</p>
<p>
 For example, if you need 3 bulbs to illuminate a room, then we donâ€™t count the time when there were only 2 bulbs or only one. If the last argument of the function is not passed, then one light bulb is enough to illuminate the room.
</p>
<p>
 The task is still the same - to find out how long the room was lit (in this task, we can say - sufficiently lit).

 <strong>
  Input:
 </strong>
 Five arguments and only the first one is required. 
    The first one
 <i>
  (els)
 </i>
 is a list of datetime objects (instead of datetime object there can be a tuple of two datetime and int), the second
 <i>
  (start_watching)
 </i>
 and the third ones
 <i>
  (end_watching)
 </i>
 are the datetime objects. The forth argument
 <i>
  (operating)
 </i>
 - timedelta object - how long the lamp can work. The 5th argument is a positive non-zero int.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Output:
 </strong>
 A number of seconds as an integer.
