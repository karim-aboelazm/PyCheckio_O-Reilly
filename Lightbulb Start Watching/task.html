<h2>Lightbulb Start Watching</h2>
<!-- Describe task in general -->
<p>
 <i>
  This is the second mission in the lightbulb series. I will try to make each following task slightly more complex.
 </i>
</p>
<p>
 You have already learned how to count the amount of time a light bulb has been on, or how long a room has been lit. Now let's add one more parameter - the counting start time.
</p>
<p>
 This means that the light continues to turn on and off as before. But now, as a result of the function, I want not only to know how long there was light in the room, but how long the room was lit, starting from a certain moment.
</p>
<p>
 One more argument is added –
 <b>
  start_watching
 </b>
 , and if it’s not passed, we count as in the previous version of the program for the entire period.

<!-- Explain input and output values -->

 <strong>
  Input:
 </strong>
 Two arguments and only the first one is required. The first one is a list of datetime objects and the second one is a datetime object.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Output:
 </strong>
 A number of seconds as an integer.
